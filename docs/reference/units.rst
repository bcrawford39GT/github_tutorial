Units
=====

In this python_github_tutorial package, the input and output values are unitless (i.e., no units were used).  

If units were used in your software, you should specify them here and how they are utilized. 
This includes specifiying the unitless variables, so the user knows. A good code will test for 
the unit values and unitless values, minimizing user input error. 

.. note::
    The `unyt <https://unyt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ can automatically convert units 
    for you so the users can input any units, provided they are in the proper form.  
    If the ``unyt`` package is used, it should be mentioned here, specifying where and 
    how it was used (i.e., what values it was used on). 
    Using the ``unyt`` package also allows the software to accept and convert the units, 
    if in proper form, to a specific unit for easy calculation in the software functions.
